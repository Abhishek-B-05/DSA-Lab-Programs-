# üìò Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts using **C programming**. It serves as a practical reference for learning and understanding how fundamental data structures work internally ‚Äî including **linked lists, stacks, queues, sorting, and searching** algorithms.
